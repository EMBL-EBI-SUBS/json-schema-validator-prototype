# JSON Schema Validator Prototype

This repository contains a prototype version of a validator using [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/)
 at this point in version `draft-06` (the next version, _draft-07_, is in the final feedback month before publication).
 
This validator uses the Java library [JSON Schema Validator (1.6.0)](https://github.com/everit-org/json-schema).
